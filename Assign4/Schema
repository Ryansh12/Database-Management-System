Use the tables created in assignment no 2 and execute the following queries:
1.	Find the professor details and department details using NATURAL JOIN.
2.	Find the prof_id, prof_name and  shift. (INNER JOIN)
3.	List all the department details and the corresponding names of professors in the same department.(left outer join)
4.	List all the professors and the corresponding names of department.(right outer join)
5.	Display professor name, dept_name, shift, salary where prof_id = 101;(multitable join)
6.	list the total number of professor in each department.(count and any join,groupby)
7.	List the prof_id associated department and the dept_name having name ‘computer’;(subquery)
8.	Find the names of all departments where the professors joined in year 2015 (or date of joining is 1-1-2015).(subquery)
9.	Create view showing the professor and shift details. (COMPLEX VIEW)
10.	Perform Manipulation on simple view-Insert, update, delete, drop view.



A4: Guidelines
Natural Join, Inner Join/Equi Join, Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join, Count+Join, 2 queries on Subquery, complex view and manipulation on simple view must be covered.
